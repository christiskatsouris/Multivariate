# I. Likelihood-Based Inference: Multivariate CAPM Model

## Example 1

Consider the following model for the excess returns 

$$Z_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_i Z_{mt} + \epsilon_{it},$$ 
such that it holds that  
$$E ( \epsilon_{it} ) = 0, \ \  Var( \epsilon_{it} ) = \sigma_{\epsilon_i}^2$$. 

We estimate the above multivariate CAPM model asset by asset using Ordinary Least Squares methods.
